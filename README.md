# canadian-cities-statistics

## Why is it built
- One of the current trends in modern software applications is to query different data
sources with various data formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV. These formats are
widely used in several business domains, including distributed systems and data
analytics, to foster data retrieval and analysis.
- The app is built to deal with these data format.
- The data that I am going to use in this project is extracted from the [World Cities
Database](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)
## What it does
- Parse data in JSON, XML, and CSV
- Manipulate data by queries (population, distance between cities, etc) 
- Windown Form App using C#
